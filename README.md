## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Jalal, and this readme file provides a categorical summarization of some of the representative repos I have on my Github account. You can also visit my [Portfolio website](https://www.jalalq.ca/) for some of my works which I have hosted live, and my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jalaluddin-qureshi/) to learn more about my background. 

Projects which I completed on algorithm design for computational problems can be accessed from my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pD7SKxQAAAAJ&hl=en) profile. One of my best work had been the design of [Triangular Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_network_coding) in which I designed a coding schme with encoding-decoding computational complexities of *O(k log k)* within minimal overhead, *k* is the number of data packets. My closest competitor, [Raptor code](https://www.qualcomm.com/media/documents/files/raptorq-technical-overview.pdf), US patented and owned by Qualcomm has a complexity of *O(k<sup>1.5</sup>)*.

### Front-end
- [x] [Interactive CSS based Animation](https://github.com/JalalQ/5104-CSS-Animation) - Created animation based on **CSS**, with **Javascript** used for user interaction. 
- [x] [Desktop Restaurant Website](https://github.com/JalalQ/5103-Restaurant-Group) - In this project my team used **Javascript, HTML and CSS** to design and develop the website for a restaurant.
- [x] [Photoshop mockup Responsive implementation](https://github.com/JalalQ/5104-Photoshop-Responsive-Mockup) - Designed of web pages using **Adobe Photoshop**, and developed that design using **CSS and HTML** so that it is **responsive** for desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

### Back-end 
- [x] [Twitter and Google Map APIs integration](https://github.com/JalalQ/5203-Twitter-GoogleMap-Apis) - Integration of multiple API (Application Programming Interface) so that user can see on map the location of user posting tweets containing a keyword. **PHP** and **Javascript** was used to send request to the Twitter and Google Map APIs respectively.
- [x] [Ticket Support System XML DOM](https://github.com/JalalQ/5203-Ticket-Support-XML) - Implementation of a ticket support system, with two different user privilage, admin, and client. **XML** was used to store data, and **PHP DOM** was used to interact with the XML document.
- [x] [Medical Clinic website, responsive](https://github.com/JalalQ/5202-PHP-Group-Clinic) - Group project in which my team designed and developed the website for a medical clinic using **PHP and MySQL database**. The content on the website was dynamic and database driven

### Database
- [x] [Database design on Access](https://github.com/JalalQ/4007-Access-Database) - Designed an ERD and created its database on **Microsoft Access**. Forms and reports were created for end-users to interact with the database tables.
- [x] [MySQL Queries](https://github.com/JalalQ/5105-MySQL-Queries) - **SQL queries** to extract information across multiple connected tables in a database.

### Data Analytics, Machine Learning
- [x] [Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/JalalQ/4023-Anaconda-Cutomer-Segmentation) - Segmentation of customers profile based on **clustering**, and then perfroming **classification** to identify value conscious customers. **Python Anaconda** was used to perform the analysis.
- [x] [Data ETL and Visualization](https://github.com/JalalQ/4022-Data-Preparation-Visualization) - Auditing and cleaning structured data using **SAS**, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and then coming up with visualization reports using **Tableau**.
- [x] [Class balance and imbalance models](https://github.com/JalalQ/4045-Classification-Anaconda) - Worked on a business problem (determining whether company would be able to sell procured obsolete electronic components) with balance and imbalance classes in the dataset.
